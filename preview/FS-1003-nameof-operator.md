# F# RFC FS-1003 - nameof Operator

The design suggestion [nameof operator](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/252) has been marked "approved in principle".
This RFC covers the detailed proposal for this suggestion.

[Discussion thread](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues/48)

* [x] Approved in principle
* [x] Details: [Resolved](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharpLangDesign/issues/48)
* [x] Implementation: [Complete](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharp/pull/6325)

### Introduction

It's often useful to obtain the simple (unqualified) string name of a variable, type, or member.

Today users end up writing something like this:

```fsharp
let add x y =
    if x < 0 then raise (ArgumentOutOfRangeException("x"))
    x + y
```

It would be useful to have this to extract the name of expressions, like:

```fsharp
let add x y =
    if x < 0 then raise (ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(x))
    x + y
```

### Naming 

The name of the operator is `nameof`

### Performance considerations

This substitution should be done at compile time, no performance impact expected

### Valid names

Names of members must be static or come from an instance.

So the following code that attempts to get the name of an instance property with an instance of its containing class is not valid:

```fsharp
type C() =
    member __.M = ()
    
nameof C.M // Error!
```

But the following are valid::

```fsharp
type C() =
    static member M = ()
    member __.M2 = ()
    
nameof C.M // Yay :)

let c = C()
nameof c.M2 // Yay :)
```

### Testing considerations

The standard range of testing  considerations for F# library functions apply.

Additional considerations:

- handle cases where `nameof` already resolves to something user-defined, to avoid being a breaking change
- when used like a function, `let f = nameof ;; f x`
- when used with pipe operator, `x |> nameof`
- works in quotations
- works with provided symbol names, i.e. generated by type providers
- works with method parameters
- works with local variables
- works with local (nested) functions
- works with local curried functions
- works with local tupled functions
- can get name from inside a local function (needs to be let rec)
- can get member names
- can get static member names
- can get static property names
- can get names that quoted in <code>``</code>
- can get names of operators like `+`, `|>`, `typeof`, `nameof`, ...
- can be used in pattern matching
- can be used with generic functions/types
- works in attributes
- works with namespaces, `nameof System.Diagnostics`
- works with types, `nameof System.String`
- works with modules, `nameof List`
- works with type arguments, `let f<'t> (x : 't) = nameof 't`
